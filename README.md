Paint-by-Pixel Image Creation App written in JavaScript and CSS

This project was created for the [Etch-a-Sketch assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project) as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. I met all the assignment objectives and then expanded on it with my own concepts to take it from an Etch-a-Sketch to a fully-functioning paint app (minus the ability to save).

### Objectives

1. Website with 16x16 grid of square DIVs
2. Change color of each DIV on mouse-over
3. A "clear" button to clear the grid
4. Adjustable grid size, no larger than 100x100
5. Option to use random color per pixel

### Scope Creep

* Change color on click (and drag) instead of just mouse-over
* Erase painted pixels
* Change grid color
* Show/hide grid
* Change canvas color
* Responsive Design
* PWA and A2HS support
